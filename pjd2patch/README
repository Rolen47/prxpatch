pjd2patch: in-game prx patcher by codestation

Usage:

* Copy pjd2patch.prx to the ms0:/seplugins directory of the PSP and enable
  it in game.txt (the plugins can be in a separate directory inside seplugins,
  e.g. ms0:/seplugins/pjd2patch to avoid cluttering the plugins directory).

* Copy the patchfile pjd2_translation.bin in the same place as the plugin

To create the patchfile run "pjd2convert pjd2_translation.txt"

Note: the pjd2_translation.txt file must be in shift-jis encoding.
