# Translation file for Project Diva 2nd (v1.01) (use shift-jis to edit the file)
# 0x08xxxxxx: use this format to rewrite the pointed address
#             to a newly allocated one for the translation.
# !x08xxxxxx: use this type of format if the address to modify
#             is embedded inside a instruction (use the lower
#             address part of the instruction for the address).
# ^x08xxxxxx: use this type of format if the address to modify
#             is embedded inside a instruction and you only need
#             to patch the upper address (the lui is behind many
#             branch instructions).
# $x08xxxxxx: use this type of format if the address to modify
#             is embedded inside a instruction and you only need
#             to patch the lower address
