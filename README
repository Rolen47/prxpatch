mhpatch: in-game prx patcher by codestation

Usage:

* Copy mhp3patch.prx and mhp3patch_user.prx to the ms0:/seplugins directory
of the PSP and enable mhp3patch.prx in game.txt (the plugins can be in a
separate directory inside seplugins, e.g. ms0:/seplugins/mhpatch to avoid
cluttering the plugins directory).

* Copy the patchfile to the root of the ms, (e.g.: ms0:/)

Format of the patchfile:

patch_count: 4 bytes -> number of patches

patch_offset[0]: 4 bytes -> offset of the patch in memory
patch_size[0]: 4 bytes -> size of the patch
...
patch_offset[patch_count-1]: 4 bytes -> offset of the patch in memory
patch_size[patch_count-1]: 4 bytes -> size of the patch

padding: the needed bytes to make the next section a multiple of 16

patch_file[0]: patch_size[0] bytes -> 1st patch
...
patch_file[patch_count-1]: patch_size[patch_count-1] bytes -> last patch

BMP_image: 391734 bytes -> BMP image used for a bootsplash (480x272) (24bits)
------------
Known issues: the bootsplash dont work with TV-out yet (investigating the issue)
