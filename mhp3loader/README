mhp3loader: in-game prx patcher by codestation

Usage:

* Copy mhp3loader.prx and to the ms0:/seplugins directory of the PSP and 
  enable mhp3loader.prx in game.txt (the plugins can be in a separate directory
  inside seplugins, e.g. ms0:/seplugins/mhp3loader to avoid cluttering the plugins
  directory).

* Copy the base translation files to ms0:/mhp3rd/patch, the files must be using the
  xxxx.bin name and be encrypted already.
  
* Copy all the modded files to ms0:/mhp3rd/extra, the files must be using the
  xxxx.bin name and be encrypted already. These files override the ones in the patch
  folder so you can use it for permanent mods.
  
 * Copy all the quest modded files to ms0:/mhp3rd/quest/<quest mib number>, the files
  must be using the xxxx.bin name and be encrypted already. These files override the
  ones in the extra and patch folder BUT they are only going to be loaded if the quest
  being loaded matches the folder number (not implemented yet).
