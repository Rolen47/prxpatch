mhp3loader: in-game prx patcher by codestation

Usage:

* Copy mhp3loader.prx and to the ms0:/seplugins directory of the PSP and 
  enable mhp3loader.prx in game.txt (the plugins can be in a separate directory
  inside seplugins, e.g. ms0:/seplugins/mhp3loader to avoid cluttering the plugins
  directory).
  
* Place the file called index.bin (use mhtools to get that from your data.bin) in the
  ms0:/mhp3rd/ folder.

* Copy the base translation files to ms0:/mhp3rd/patch, the files must be using the
  xxxx.bin name and be encrypted already.
  
* Copy all the modded files to ms0:/mhp3rd/extra, the files must be using the
  xxxx.bin name and be encrypted already. These files override the ones in the patch
  folder so you can use it for permanent mods.
  
 * Copy all the quest modded files to ms0:/mhp3rd/quest/<quest mib number>, the files
  must be using the xxxx.bin name and be encrypted already. These files override the
  ones in the extra and patch folder BUT they are only going to be loaded if the quest
  being loaded matches the folder number.

 * If you want the mods per quest to work in online mode (i.e. receiving a quest from 
   another player) then you need to generate a mib_id.dat and place it in ms0:mhp3rd/quest/.
   This file contains the hashes of the decrypted mib files so the plugin can recognize
   them when they are loaded and do the redirection.
   
   To create the file just place all the decrypted mib that you want to use and run
   "python gen_id.py *.mib", this will read all the decrypted mib files and generate the
   mib_id.dat with the hashes on it.
